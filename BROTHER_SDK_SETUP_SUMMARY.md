# üéâ Brother SDK Setup Complete!

## ‚úÖ What's Been Successfully Configured

### iOS Setup (Complete)
- **Brother SDK**: BRLMPrinterKit.xcframework v4.1.30 installed
- **Location**: `ios/Frameworks/BRLMPrinterKit.xcframework/`
- **Features**: Bluetooth Classic, Bluetooth LE, WiFi, MFi authentication
- **Plugin**: Updated to use modern BRLMPrinterKit API
- **CocoaPods**: All dependencies installed
- **Permissions**: MFi protocols and Bluetooth permissions configured

### Android Setup (Pending)
- **Required**: Download `BrotherPrintLibrary.jar` from Brother developer portal
- **Location**: Place in `android/app/libs/BrotherPrintLibrary.jar`
- **Plugin**: Already configured for Brother SDK

## üîß Building with xtool.sh

Since xtool.sh is designed for SwiftPM projects and this is a Flutter/Xcode project, you have a few options:

### Option 1: Use Flutter Build (Recommended)
```bash
# This won't work on Linux, but would work on macOS
flutter build ios --release
```

### Option 2: Direct Xcode Build (if you have Xcode tools)
```bash
cd ios
xcodebuild -workspace Runner.xcworkspace -scheme Runner -configuration Release
```

### Option 3: xtool.sh Alternative Approach
Since xtool.sh is for SwiftPM projects, you could:
1. Extract the Swift code from the Flutter project
2. Create a new SwiftPM project with xtool
3. Integrate the Brother SDK there

### Option 4: Cross-Platform Development
- Develop and test on macOS with Xcode
- Use xtool.sh for other iOS development tasks
- Deploy to device using xtool: `xtool install path/to/app`

## üì± Testing the Brother SDK

### Prerequisites
1. **Physical iOS Device**: Simulator won't work for Bluetooth/MFi
2. **Brother Printer**: Any supported model (QL-820NWB, QL-1110NWB, etc.)
3. **App Installation**: Use xtool to install the built app

### Test Steps
1. Build the app (using available method)
2. Install: `xtool install build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app`
3. Open app and navigate to Brother Printer Setup
4. Test printer discovery and connection
5. Try printing a test badge

## üîç Verification Commands

### Check Brother SDK Installation
```bash
# Verify framework exists
ls -la ios/Frameworks/BRLMPrinterKit.xcframework/

# Check CocoaPods installation
ls -la ios/Pods/ | grep -i brother

# Verify plugin is updated
grep -n "BRLMPrinterKit" ios/Runner/BrotherPrinterPlugin.swift
```

### Check Android SDK Status
```bash
# Check if Brother JAR is installed
ls -la android/app/libs/BrotherPrintLibrary.jar

# If not found, download from:
# https://support.brother.com/g/s/es/dev/en/mobilesdk/android/index.html
```

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Complete Android Setup**: Download Brother Android SDK
2. **Build iOS App**: Use available build method for your environment
3. **Test on Device**: Install with xtool and test Brother printer functionality
4. **Development**: Continue with cross-platform development using xtool.sh for iOS-specific tasks

## üéØ Brother SDK Integration Status

| Platform | SDK Status | Plugin Status | Build Ready |
