# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing event check-in mobile app by implementing native Brother label printing capabilities with direct printing (no dialogs), MFi compliance for iOS, and Bluetooth connectivity support for both Android and iOS platforms. The goal is to provide seamless, professional badge printing for event check-ins without user intervention or print dialogs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Native Brother Label Printer Integration

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want to print badges directly to Brother label printers without any print dialogs, so that I can quickly process attendee check-ins without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a badge print is requested THEN the system SHALL send the print job directly to the connected Brother printer without showing any print dialogs
2. WHEN printing to Brother printers THEN the system SHALL use native Brother SDK integration for optimal print quality and speed
3. WHEN a Brother printer is connected THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the printer model and configure appropriate print settings
4. WHEN printing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options without showing system print dialogs

### Requirement 2: MFi Compliance for iOS

**User Story:** As an iOS user, I want to connect to MFi-certified Brother printers seamlessly, so that I can use official Apple-approved accessories without compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to Brother printers on iOS THEN the system SHALL use MFi-compliant communication protocols
2. WHEN an MFi-certified Brother printer is available THEN the system SHALL prioritize it over non-certified alternatives
3. WHEN MFi authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL handle the authentication process transparently without user intervention
4. IF MFi authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 3: Bluetooth Connectivity Support

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to connect to Brother printers via Bluetooth, so that I can print badges without requiring WiFi or cable connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for printers THEN the system SHALL discover available Brother printers via Bluetooth
2. WHEN a Bluetooth Brother printer is selected THEN the system SHALL establish and maintain a stable connection
3. WHEN Bluetooth connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection and notify the user of connection status
4. WHEN multiple Bluetooth printers are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to select and remember their preferred printer

### Requirement 4: Cross-Platform Android Support

**User Story:** As an Android user, I want the same native Brother printing capabilities as iOS users, so that I can have consistent functionality across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app on Android THEN the system SHALL provide identical Brother printing functionality as iOS
2. WHEN connecting via Bluetooth on Android THEN the system SHALL use Android's Bluetooth APIs for Brother printer communication
3. WHEN Android permissions are required THEN the system SHALL request and handle Bluetooth and location permissions appropriately
4. WHEN Android Bluetooth is disabled THEN the system SHALL prompt users to enable Bluetooth and guide them through the process

### Requirement 5: Direct Printing Without Dialogs

**User Story:** As an event staff member, I want badge printing to happen instantly without any confirmation dialogs, so that I can maintain fast check-in flow during busy periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a print command is issued THEN the system SHALL send the job directly to the printer without showing any confirmation dialogs
2. WHEN print settings need adjustment THEN the system SHALL use pre-configured settings stored in the app preferences
3. WHEN printing is successful THEN the system SHALL show a brief success indicator without interrupting the workflow
4. WHEN printing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with minimal user interaction required

### Requirement 6: Printer Management and Configuration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure Brother printer settings once and have them persist, so that staff don't need to reconfigure printers repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Brother printer is first connected THEN the system SHALL save the printer configuration for future use
2. WHEN printer settings are modified THEN the system SHALL persist these settings across app restarts
3. WHEN multiple printers are configured THEN the system SHALL allow selection of a default printer
4. WHEN printer firmware updates are available THEN the system SHALL notify users and provide update guidance

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a technical support person, I want detailed error information when printing fails, so that I can quickly troubleshoot and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN printing errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including printer model, connection type, and error codes
2. WHEN connection issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide specific troubleshooting steps based on the error type
3. WHEN printer status changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect current printer availability and status
4. WHEN diagnostic information is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a printer diagnostic screen with connection and capability details

### Requirement 8: Optimized Badge Layout for Label Printers

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want badges to be optimized for Brother label printers, so that they print clearly and efficiently on label stock.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating badges for Brother printers THEN the system SHALL optimize layout for label dimensions and resolution
2. WHEN printing on different label sizes THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust badge content to fit the selected label format
3. WHEN high-resolution printing is available THEN the system SHALL use maximum printer resolution for crisp text and graphics
4. WHEN label stock is low THEN the system SHALL detect and warn users before attempting to print

### Requirement 9: Background Printing and Queue Management

**User Story:** As an event staff member, I want to queue multiple badge print jobs, so that I can continue checking in attendees while previous badges are still printing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple print jobs are requested THEN the system SHALL queue them and process them sequentially
2. WHEN a print job is queued THEN the system SHALL show queue status and estimated completion time
3. WHEN print jobs fail THEN the system SHALL allow retry or removal from queue
4. WHEN the app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL continue processing the print queue

### Requirement 10: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want badge printing to be fast and responsive, so that check-in processes don't create bottlenecks during peak event times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating badge PDFs THEN the system SHALL optimize rendering for Brother printer capabilities
2. WHEN sending print jobs THEN the system SHALL compress and optimize data transmission to reduce print time
3. WHEN multiple badges are printed THEN the system SHALL batch process them efficiently
4. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL initialize printer connections in the background to reduce first-print latency

### Requirement 11: Simulator Build Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to build and run in iOS simulators without Brother SDK dependencies, so that I can develop and test other features without requiring physical Brother printers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for iOS simulator THEN the system SHALL exclude Brother SDK dependencies and native printer code
2. WHEN running in simulator mode THEN the system SHALL provide mock printer functionality for testing UI flows
3. WHEN Brother printer features are accessed in simulator THEN the system SHALL show appropriate "simulator mode" messages instead of crashing
4. WHEN building for physical devices THEN the system SHALL include full Brother SDK functionality and native printer support
